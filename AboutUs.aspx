        Platinum Coaching centre&nbsp; is a coaching centre for students from Year 1-Year 9. We are dedicated to bringing out the best in children and nurturing their talent, realising each and every child's potential by focusing on them individually,
helping them achieve their study goals and encouraging them to embrace learning opportunities. 
        
        We guide students in the right direction towards the Opportunity Class test, the Selective Schools Test, Scholarship tests and Talented Class test, as well as developing interview and writing skills.

       
        
        Acquiring concepts is important, but the way of thinking that we nurture here at Platinum Coaching centre&nbsp; is special. The method of the learning process and the attitude maintained towards it, is more important.<br />
       
&nbsp;We teach students the creative, logical ways of solving problems, and thinking individually. They are taught to think freely and explore various methods of thinking.


        Our teaching expertise has led to many student successes over the duration of our academic years,
            with the help of the exceptional dedication of our teaching staff.
